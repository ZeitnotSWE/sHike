##What is this?

It's basically a tool for hikers, created with intention of monitoring and storing user's performance.
This project was commissioned by [Si14](http://www.si14.com/), but it was part of the [Computer Science](http://informatica.math.unipd.it/index.html)'s [Software Engineering teaching course](http://www.math.unipd.it/~tullio/IS-1/2014/) held in [University of Padua](http://www.unipd.it/).  

The web client it's Spring Framework + Bootstrap, while the Android app is written in Java.



In this repository you will find the source codes for web client and Android app, the source codes for the client and all the documentation (in italian language), partially related to the teaching and not interesting by most of the users.
