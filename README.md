#sHike

Activity tracker for hikers, made by the Zeitnot team.
(Software Engineering didactic project, AY 2014/2015, BSc in Computer Science, University of Padua)


##Zeitnot
We are a team of 7 students who were majoring in Computer Science at the time the project was made.
The members are:  
- Andrea Boscolo Nata
- Davide Canal
- Jacopo Cavallarin
- Andrea Costa
- Mario Garavello
- Tiziano Longo
- Luca Tiozzo Brasiola


##What is this?

It's basically a tool for hikers to monitor and store their performance.
This project was commissioned by [Si14 s.p.a.](http://www.si14.com/) as part of the [Software Engineering teaching course](http://www.math.unipd.it/~tullio/IS-1/2014/), for the [BSc in Computer Science](http://informatica.math.unipd.it/laurea/index.html) of the [University of Padua](http://www.unipd.it/).  

The tool consists of 2 parts: a web client, and an Android app for the [WearIT smartwatch](http://www.wearit.net/).
The app does all the monitoring while the web client is used to manage the user's results and stats.
Both parts were written in Java: we used the Spring Framework and Bootstrap for the web client and Android Studio for the app.



In this repository you will find complete sources of the web client and the Android app and all the documentation written during the project (in italian only).
The documents are partly related to the teaching course, thus they they might not be useful for everyone.
